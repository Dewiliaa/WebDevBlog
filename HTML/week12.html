        <p>Hi there!
        <br><br>
        In Week 12, we explored RestDB, a cloud-based database service that allows for easy creation and 
        management of RESTful APIs and databases.
        <br><br>
        The weekly activity involved creating a Student CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application using RestDB.
        <br><br>
        This application allowed for the management of student data, including fields such as Name, Student ID, 
        Student Mentor, Student Class, and additional fields. We ensured a seamless user experience by employing 
        appropriate form elements, facilitating easy data input and interaction.
        <br><br>
        Additionally, we tackled the challenge of implementing the Delete feature by leveraging RestDB API sample 
        code and following provided instructions in the repl.it environment. Through this activity, we gained 
        practical insights into building CRUD applications and working with RestDB for efficient data management.
        <br><br>
        Okay that's all for this week! See you later alligator.</p>
