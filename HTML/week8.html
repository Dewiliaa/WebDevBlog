        <h2>&#127881 Week 8! &#127881</h2>
        <p>Hi there!<br><br>In Week 8, we delved into several key concepts:
        <br><br>
        - Script Placement: We learned the importance of placing scripts before the closing body tag to prevent 
        blocking and ensure that the DOM has loaded before script execution.
        <br><br>
        - Data Attributes: Explored the usage of data attributes in HTML, providing a way to store extra 
        information in the DOM for JavaScript to access and manipulate.
        <br><br>
        - API Implementation: Learned about APIs and how to integrate them into web applications, enabling us to 
        fetch and utilize external data dynamically.
        <br><br>
        For this week's activity, it allowed us to practice fetching data from an external API and manipulating 
        it dynamically within our web application using JavaScript and potentially jQuery for enhanced 
        interactivity.
        <br><br>Okay that's all for this week! See you later alligator.</p>
