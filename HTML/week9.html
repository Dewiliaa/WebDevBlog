        <p>Hi there!
        <br><br>
        In Week 9, we delved into Bootstrap, a popular front-end framework for building responsive and 
        mobile-first websites.
        <br><br>
        Bootstrap provides a set of CSS and JavaScript components that streamline web development and 
        ensure consistency across different devices and screen sizes.
        <br><br>
        For the weekly activity, we applied our knowledge of Bootstrap to create a simple "About Me" page. 
        By leveraging Bootstrap's predefined classes and components, such as grids, navigation bars, and cards, 
        we were able to design a visually appealing and responsive webpage efficiently. This activity helped us 
        understand how to utilize Bootstrap to enhance the layout, design, and functionality of our web projects.
        <br><br>Okay that's all for this week! See you later alligator.</p>
