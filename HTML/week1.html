        <h2>&#127881 Week 1! &#127881</h2>
        <p>Hi there!<br><br>During our first week, we delved into essential tools like Repl.it and GitHub, 
        and got familiar with setting up Visual Studio Code for our coding journey.<br><br>
        We explored the fundamentals of HTML and CSS, learning how to structure web pages using elements like 
        html, body, and head.<br><br>We also gained proficiency in incorporating basic elements such as 
        headings, paragraphs, and images using tags like img src.<br><br>In a hands-on activity, we crafted a 
        recipe card, employing common HTML tags including headings, paragraphs, ordered lists, 
        and unordered lists.This foundational experience has equipped us with the skills needed to begin our 
        journey into web development.<br><br>Okay that's all for this week! See you later alligator.</p>
