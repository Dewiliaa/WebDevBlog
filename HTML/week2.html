        <h2>&#127881 Week 2! &#127881</h2>
        <p>Hi there!<br><br>In week 2, we delved deeper into best practices for file naming, emphasizing the 
        importance of lowercase letters, meaningful names without spaces, and the use of hyphens for clarity. 
        We explored HTML5 semantics, incorporating elements like header, nav, article, and section to 
        enhance the structure and organization of our web pages.<br><br>
        A significant highlight was learning how to leverage the inspector mode to swiftly identify and rectify 
        errors in our code. This hands-on approach empowered us to understand the intricacies of CSS styling, 
        deciphering the purpose of each line and its impact on our web design.<br><br>Furthermore, we delved into 
        various methods of styling HTML, including inline styles, embedded styles, and external style sheets, 
        enabling us to apply colors effectively and utilize heading tags such as h1, h2, and h3 for 
        semantic structuring. This week has marked a pivotal step in our journey towards mastering web 
        development techniques.<br><br>Okay that's all for this week! See you later alligator.</p>
