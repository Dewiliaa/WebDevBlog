        <p>Hi there!<br><br>In Week 7, we delved into essential concepts for dynamic web development:
        <br><br>
        - DOM (Document Object Model): We learned about the structure of HTML documents represented as a tree-like 
        structure in the browser's memory, enabling JavaScript to manipulate the content, structure, and style of 
        web pages dynamically.
        <br><br>
        - Event handling and validation: We explored how JavaScript can respond to user interactions like clicks, 
        keyboard input, and form submissions. Additionally, we learned about client-side form validation to ensure 
        data entered by users meets specified criteria before submission.
        <br><br>
        - JSON local storage: We discovered how to use JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) to store data locally in 
        the browser, allowing for persistent data storage across sessions without relying on server-side databases.
        <br><br>
        For this week's activity, we worked on a grocery list application, focusing on DOM manipulation and 
        element selection in JavaScript. We used loops and various DOM methods like getElementsByClassName() 
        and getElementsByTagName() to select specific elements and modify their attributes dynamically. 
        The tasks involved changing the class attributes of elements based on certain conditions, providing 
        practical experience in DOM manipulation and JavaScript programming.
        <br><br>Okay that's all for this week! See you later alligator.</p>
