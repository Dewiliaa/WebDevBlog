        <p>Hi there!
        <br><br>
        In Week 14, we explored Lottie, a library that enables the use of high-quality animations in web and 
        mobile applications. 
        <br><br>
        Lottie allows developers to easily integrate complex animations into their projects using JSON files 
        exported from Adobe After Effects or similar animation tools.
        <br><br>
        This technology brings dynamic and engaging visual elements to websites and applications, enhancing user 
        experience and interaction.
        <br><br>
        This week has been the most interesting part of this module because it's the animation has really added
        alot of character to websites.
        <br><br>
        We have come to the end of my journey learning FED! See you later alligator.</p>
