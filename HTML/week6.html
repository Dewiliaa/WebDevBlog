        <h2>&#127881 Week 6! &#127881</h2>
        <p>Hi there!<br><br>In Week 6, we deepened our understanding of JavaScript, a versatile language for 
        web development. We explored its capabilities in creating interactive web experiences, such as games.
        <br><br>
        For our activity, we crafted a Karaoke Party game called "OverBae." We practiced defining singer characters 
        using both literal and function-based objects in JavaScript.
        <br><br>
        1. We began by defining a literal object variable named "momobae," capturing the properties of a singer 
        like name, specialty, power, and more, with each property assigned its respective data type.
        <br><br>
        2. Then, we crafted a function-based object method named "Singer" to represent singer characters. This 
        involved setting up a constructor function with parameters for the singer's properties. Inside, we 
        initialized variables and defined methods to calculate maximum power and print singer profiles using 
        template literals.
        <br><br>
        3. Finally, we created two new singer objects using our function-based method, storing them in 
        an array. We implemented a loop function to cycle through the array, printing out each singer's profile.
        <br><br>Okay that's all for this week! See you later alligator.</p>
