        <h2>&#127881 Week 4! &#127881</h2>
        <p>Hi there!<br><br>In week 4, our focus expanded to more advanced techniques in web development, 
        encompassing the following key topics:<br><br>
        1. Responsive Images: We delved into the concept of responsive images, learning how to optimize images for 
        various screen sizes and resolutions to ensure a consistent and optimal user experience across devices. 
        By employing techniques such as the srcset attribute and sizes attribute, we can provide different image 
        sources based on device characteristics, enhancing performance and user engagement.
        <br><br>
        2. Flex Layouts: Building upon our understanding of CSS layout mechanisms, we delved deeper into 
        flex layouts. Flexbox is a powerful layout model that offers a more efficient and intuitive way to 
        design complex web layouts, especially for responsive designs. Through practical exercises, we gained 
        proficiency in using flexbox properties to create flexible and adaptive layouts that adapt seamlessly 
        to different screen sizes and orientations.
        <br><br>
        3. Git & GitHub Pages: We explored the fundamentals of version control using Git and the collaborative 
        features of GitHub Pages. Version control allows us to track changes to our codebase, collaborate with 
        team members, and manage project history effectively. GitHub Pages provides a platform for hosting static 
        websites directly from GitHub repositories, enabling seamless deployment and sharing of web projects with 
        the global community.<br><br>For the class activity this week, I applied the concepts learned to create 
        new media queries tailored specifically for mobile devices. These media queries allow us to fine-tune 
        the layout and styling of our web pages to provide an optimal viewing experience on smartphones and tablets.
        By incorporating responsive design principles and media queries, we ensure that our web content remains 
        accessible and visually appealing across a wide range of devices and screen sizes.<br><br>Okay that's 
        all for this week! See you later alligator.</p>
